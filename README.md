# CommentPulse 

CommentPulse is an AI-powered web application that analyzes the tone and toxicity of user comments and rewrites them in a more constructive, respectful way. The project leverages **Google Gemini** for natural language understanding and **MongoDB** for storing analysis history.

Built as a hackathon project, CommentPulse demonstrates how **Generative AI can be applied to real-world communication and moderation challenges**.

## Features

- AI-powered comment tone & toxicity analysis  
- AI-generated rewritten comments to reduce negativity  
- Google Gemini API integration for NLP tasks  
- MongoDB storage for comment history  
- Interactive and simple web interface  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **AI / NLP:** Google Gemini API  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **APIs:** RESTful API architecture  

---

## How It Works

1. User submits a comment through the web interface  
2. The backend server receives the input  
3. The server calls the **Google Gemini API** to:
   - Analyze tone and toxicity
   - Generate a more constructive rewritten version
4. Results are stored in **MongoDB**  
5. The analyzed output is returned and displayed to the user

### What I Learned
- Integrating Generative AI APIs into production-style applications
- Designing end-to-end AI pipelines (input → model → output → persistence)
- Managing API keys and environment variables securely
- Building a full-stack web application using Node.js and MongoDB

—--

### Context
This project was built as part of the Hack for Hackers (MLH) Hackathon, focused on improving online communication through AI-powered moderation.

### Future Improvements
- Sentiment and toxicity score visualization
- More granular toxicity categories
- User authentication and saved analysis history
- Public deployment (Vercel / Render)
